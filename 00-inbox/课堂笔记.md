1. benchmarking
	1. pros： easy to implement general purpose  computing
	2. cons： what can we really say in general
2. stochaastic models
3. bonding uncertainties whit intervals polytopes

## schedul
time set  [0,wuqiiong )
N of tasks 1...n
M of machines 1...m
set C constrains
	afinities: task i may execute only over Mi
	deadlines: task i must complete not later than a deadline D
	mutual exclusion: task i may not execute while task j is execution
	parallelism of tasks: task i needs 3 processors in paeallel when executing
 a scheduling alggorithm a which produces a schedule s of n over m constrains c


## task
- amount of work
- recurrent/non-
- on line/off
- sequential(only one machine at time), parallel 

composed by a sequence of jobs of sizes $C_i,j$ requested at instants a_ij
r=draw step 

t1 ≥ t0
wi(t1) ≤ wi(t0) + ri(t1) - ri(t0)
## machine


## constraints


## schedule

S : M * T -> N ∪ {0}
task 0 denoting idle compatible whith the constraints in C
S(k,t)=i machine k is assigned to the i-task at time t
	=0 not assigned at t, k-th machine is idle at t
