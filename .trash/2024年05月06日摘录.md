定义 1（常规输出）。如果 Si Si+1，对于每个 i = 1，···，m − 1，则输出消息集 (S1,····,Sm) 的序列是规则的。


Suppose that the regular sequence (S1, · · · , Sm) is gener- ated by a synchronization algorithm A, we say that the output of the algorithm A is regular.


Lemma 1. The output of the SEAM algorithm is regular. Proof. According to Lines 11, 12, and 16 of Alg. 1, the messages in the output message set Si must be removed from their corresponding queues before generating the next message set Si+1. Therefore, all the messages selected to form Si+1 have larger timestamps than the ones in Si, i.e., Si Si+1.


that the i-th message set Si is not earlier than the j-th message set Sj, i.e

· , Sm) be the non-regular output of algo- rithm A, we develop a method to transform it into a regular one (see in Alg. 2). The input of Alg. 2 is a non-regular sequence of message sets (S1, · · · , Sm). For each i = 1, · · · , m, the ith message Si is written as

than the ones in Si, i.e., Si Si+1. Lem. 1 shows that the SEAM algorithm naturally outputs the regular sequence of mess
